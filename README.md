# Rancid Tomatillos
## Abstract
Rancid Tomatillos is a movie rating app where a user can login and rate movies, comment on movies, and favorite/unfavorite movies.  

If a user doesn't have a login, they can view movie details but they aren't able to share their own ratings or comments, and they do not have favoriting capabilities. 

The User Interface is updated seamlessly as the user navigates through a multi-page experience.
